# Day Three

**Purpose of Statistics**: Make inferences about a population from a sample

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Parameter v. Statistics

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: Numbers that summarize data for an entire population

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: Numbers that summarize data from a sample

#### Why are samples necessary in statistics?

\vspace{3em}

#### Can a parameter ever be known?

\vspace{3em}

For the purpose of this class, we will primarily focus on 3 measures, each with a unique symbol for their parameter and statistic. Each measure also has a certain variable type associated with it:

| Measure            | Parameter | Statistic | Variable Type |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Mean               |           |           |               |
| Proportion         |           |           |               |
| Standard Deviation |           |           |               |

### Let's Practice

#### Fill in the missing elements.

1.  **Measure: Sample Mean**

-   Parameter or Statistic? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

-   Symbol? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2.  **Measure: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

-   Parameter or Statistic? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

-   Symbol? *s*

3.  **Measure: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Proportion**

-   Parameter or Statistic? Parameter

-   Symbol?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Types of Study Designs

**Observational Study**: A study in which the researcher collects data through observations without any manipulation of participants

#### For example...

1.  A researcher observes study habits and time management behaviors of college students in a library setting to understand factors influencing academic performance.

2.  A psychologist conducts observations in a college cafeteria to analyze eating habits and food choices among students, investigating factors such as social influences and dietary preferences.

**Experimental Study**: A study in which the researcher actively manipulates participants and splits them into a control group and treatment group(s)

**Control Group**: Participants who do not receive the experimental treatment

#### For example...

1.  A researcher examines the effects of different study environments on academic performance by randomly assigning college students to study either in a quiet library or a bustling caf√© and comparing their subsequent test scores.

2.  An education researcher investigates the impact of personalized feedback on essay writing skills by randomly assigning students to receive either generic or tailored feedback on their writing assignments and assessing improvements in writing quality.

### Let's Practice

#### State whether the situation best describes an observational or experimental study.

1.  A researcher examines the relationship between caffeine consumption and productivity levels in employees at a workplace by reviewing employee performance reports and coffee logs.

-   Experimental or Observational Study?

2.  A group of scientists studies the relationship between temperature variations and crop yields in agricultural regions by exposing different test plants to various conditions in the lab.

-   Experimental or Observational Study?

3.  A researcher investigates the impact of music genres on mood regulation in listeners by collecting survey data from Spotify users.

-   Experimental or Observational Study?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Randomness

**Random Selection**: Process by which participants are chosen for a study by chance

#### For example...

1.  A professor selects students from a class roster to participate in a research study on sleep patterns by assigning each student a unique identification number and using a random number generator to select participants.

2.  A university divides its student body into distinct groups based on academic programs. Then, it randomly picks students from each group for its survey on student satisfaction.

**Random Assignment**: Process by which the treatment is given to the observational unit by chance

#### For example...

1.  In a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of a new medication for migraine headaches, participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group, where they receive the medication, or the control group, where they receive a placebo.

2.  In an educational study examining the impact of different teaching methods on student learning outcomes, classrooms are randomly assigned to one of several experimental conditions, such as traditional lecture-based instruction or active learning strategies.

#### What is the purpose of each aspect of randomness? (hint: confounding variables & bias)

\vspace{3em}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Preview of Statistical Inference

**Statistical Inference**: Statistical technique that draws a conclusion about a population parameter based on a sample statistic

#### Two Types:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: Statistical inference that assesses the plausibility of a particular claim about the parameter

#### For example...

1.  A boss claims that it takes its employees 10 minutes, on average, to complete a particular task. To verify this claim, a random sample of 30 employees is selected, and their task completion times are recorded.

\vspace{2em}

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: Statistical inference that estimates the value of a parameter with a range of plausible values

#### For example...

1.  A manufacturing company has recently introduced a new product to the market and wants estimate its population mean defect rate. To achieve this, the company randomly selects a sample of 200 units from their production line.

#### 4 Techniques:

1.  Hypothesis Test for Population Mean $\mu$

2.  Hypothesis Test for Population Proportion *p*

3.  Confidence Interval for Population Mean $\mu$

4.  Confidence Interval for Population Proportion *p*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Video 1: One-Population Hypothesis Test (Mean, Proportion)

**Purpose of Statistics**: Make inferences about a population from a sample

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### One-Population Mean Hypothesis Test

**Assumptions:** Data is random; observations are independent

Hypotheses for Two-Tailed Test:

-   Null Hypothesis:

    -   Words: The population mean of \[context\] is equal to $\mu$~o~

    -   Symbols: H~0~: $\mu$ = $\mu$~o~

-   Alternative Hypothesis:

    -   Words: The population mean of \[context\] is not equal to $\mu$~o~

    -   Symbols: H~1~: $\mu$ $\neq$ $\mu$~o~

Test Statistic: $TS = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$

Note:

-   If TS \< -3.5 OR TS \> 3.5, we reject H~0~

-   If p-value \< 0.1, we reject H~0~ (calculator needed to find p-value)

#### For Example...

1.  A tech company asserts that the average battery life of their new smartphone model is different from the industry standard of 20 hours. A sample of 100 smartphones is tested, revealing an average battery life of 19.5 hours with a standard deviation of 2.5 hours.

#### One-Population Proportion Hypothesis Test

**Assumptions:** Data is random; *np* $\geq$ 10 & *n*(1 - *p*) $\geq$ 10

Hypotheses for Two-Tailed Test:

-   Null Hypothesis:

    -   Words: The population proportion of \[context\] is equal to *p*~o~

    -   Symbols: H~0~: *p* = *p*~o~

-   Alternative Hypothesis:

    -   Words: The population proportion of \[context\] is not equal to *p*~o~

    -   Symbols: H~1~: *p* $\neq$ *p*~o~

Test Statistic: $TS = \frac{\hat{p} - p_o}{\sqrt{\frac{p_o(1 - p_o)}{n}}}$

Note:

-   If TS \< -3.5 OR TS \> 3.5, we reject H~0~

-   If p-value \< 0.1, we reject H~0~ (calculator needed to find p-value)

#### For example...

1.  A company proposes that 30% of its customers are satisfied with its customer service. A random sample of 200 customers is surveyed, and 100 express satisfaction.

# Video 3: Types of Errors (I, II), Types of Distributions, and Confidence Interval Manipulations

**Purpose of Statistics**: Make inferences about a population from a sample

---

### Hypothesis Test Errors

**Type I Error**: Rejecting a null hypothesis that is true

**Type II Error**: Failing to reject a null hypothesis that is false

![](https://www.bachelorprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Type-I-and-Type-II-Errors-explanation.jpg)

#### For example...

1. In a clinical trial, if the company wrongly concludes that a new drug reduces blood pressure when it doesn't, it's a Type I error. This error leads to wasted resources, unnecessary side effects, and misleading conclusions.

2. If a quality control test incorrectly accepts a batch of products as meeting the quality standards when, in fact, they do not meet the standards, this would be a Type II error. As a result, defective products may enter the market, leading to potential customer dissatisfaction, product recalls, and damage to the company's reputation.

### Let's Practice

#### State whether the conclusion could entail a Type I or Type II Error.

1. Based on the results of the entrance exam, an admission office concludes that a student is likely to succeed in their program. However, it's later discovered that the student struggles academically and eventually drops out of the program.

Type of Error:

2. After analyzing the data from a semester-long study, a professor concludes that the new teaching method significantly improves student performance. However, upon further investigation, it's discovered that the conclusion was based on a statistical error, and there is no significant improvement in student performance with the new teaching method.

Type of Error: 

---

### Types of Distributions

If *n* \< 30, s is given, or nothing is stated about the distribution, use:
    
* t-distribution

Otherwise, use:
    
* z-distribution

---

### Confidence Interval Manipulations

#### Factors that affect Confidence Intervals:

- Sample size *n*

- Standard Deviation *s*

- Standard Error

- Level of Confidence

### Let's Practice

#### State whether the confidence interval shrinks or widens from a change to one of the factors.

1. What happens to the interval as *n* increases?

2. What happens to the interval as level of confidence decreases?

3. What happens to the interval as standard error increases?

4. What happens to the interval as *s* decreases?
