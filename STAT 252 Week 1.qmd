## Day Two

**Purpose of Statistics**: Make inferences about a population from a sample

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Statistical Question**: A question that can be answered by collecting data that varies

#### For example...

**How old am I?**

(not statistical)

**How old are Cal Poly students on average?**

(statistical)

**How tall is Jamear?**

(not statistical)

**How tall is the average 12-year-old in the US?**

(statistical)

### Let's Practice

#### Statistical or Not?

1.  **How many hours per week do students spend studying for exams?**

2.  **How many siblings do you have?**

3.  **What was the temperature at 12pm today?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Classifying Units of Study

**Population**: The entire group of study from which a sample is drawn

**Sample**: Part of the population from which data is gathered

**Observational Unit**: A single person, place, or thing from the sample

**Sample Size**: Total number of observational units in a sample (denoted *n*)

### Note: The content below could either be deleted other than the glossary once I put everything together or kept as a review of the week for students

## Statistical Techniques

#### 1. One-Population Hypothesis Test

-   If TS \< -3.5 OR TS \> 3.5, we reject H~0~
-   If p-value \< 0.1, we reject H~0~ (calculator needed to find p-value)
-   Type I Error: Rejecting a null hypothesis that is true
-   Type II Error: Failing to reject a null hypothesis that is false

#### <u>One-Population Mean Hypothesis Test</u>

**Assumptions:** Data is random; observations are independent

Hypotheses for Two-Tailed Test:

-   Null Hypothesis:

    -   Words: The population mean of \[context\] is equal to $\mu$~o~

    -   Symbols: H~0~: $\mu$ = $\mu$~o~

-   Alternative Hypothesis:

    -   Words: The population mean of \[context\] is not equal to $\mu$~o~

    -   Symbols: H~1~: $\mu$ $\neq$ $\mu$~o~

Test Statistic: $TS = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$

#### One-Population Proportion Hypothesis Test

**Assumptions:** Data is random; *np* $\geq$ 10 & *n*(1 - *p*) $\geq$ 10

Hypotheses for Two-Tailed Test:

-   Null Hypothesis:

    -   Words: The population proportion of \[context\] is equal to *p*~o~

    -   Symbols: H~0~: *p* = *p*~o~

-   Alternative Hypothesis:

    -   Words: The population proportion of \[context\] is not equal to *p*~o~

    -   Symbols: H~1~: *p* $\neq$ *p*~o~

Test Statistic: $TS = \frac{\hat{p} - p_o}{\sqrt{\frac{p_o(1 - p_o)}{n}}}$

#### 2. One-Population Confidence Intervals

-   Critical Value: Number of standard errors from the parameter needed to achieve a certain level of confidence (CV)
-   Margin of Error: ME = CV \* SE
-   Upper Bound: UB = PE + ME
-   Lower Bound: LB = PE - ME

#### <u>One-Population Mean Confidence Interval</u>

##### **Assumptions:** Data is random; observations are independent

Point Estimate: $\bar{x}$

Standard Error: ${\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$

#### One-Population Proportion Confidence Interval

**Assumptions:** Data is random; *np* $\geq$ 10 & *n*(1 - *p*) $\geq$ 10

Point Estimate: $\hat{p}$

Standard Error: ${\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}}$

## Other Key Concepts

#### 1. Types of Distributions

-   If *n* \< 30, s is given, or nothing is stated about the distribution, use:
    -   t-distribution
-   Otherwise, use:
    -   z-distribution

#### 2. Study Designs

-   Types:
    -   Experiment
    -   Observational Study
-   Randomness for Experiments:
    -   Random Selection
    -   Random Assignment (typically incorporates a control group)
